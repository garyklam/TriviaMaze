Welcome to the TriviaMaze!

Your goal is to reach the exit located in the bottom right of the maze.

The difficulty determines the size of the maze and the difficulty of the questions.

Choosing the custom difficulty will allow you to select a specific category of questions.

Attempting to enter a room that you have not yet visited will require you to correctly answer a trivia question.

Incorrectly answering a question will lock the door you attempted pass.

Traveling between rooms that you have already visited does not require you to answer a question.

Once the exit cannot be reached the game will end.
