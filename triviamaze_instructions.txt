Welcome to the TriviaMaze!

Your goal is to reach the exit located in the bottom right of the maze.

Starting a new game will provide the options for changing question difficulty, maze size,
and trivia category. 

Attempting to enter a room that you have not yet visited will require you to correctly answer a trivia question.

Incorrectly answering a question will lock the door you attempted pass.

Traveling between rooms that you have already visited does not require you to answer a question.

Once the exit cannot be reached the game will end.

3 save slots are avaliable and saving is possible at anytime. If a question is being displayed, 
saving the game will not save that question.
